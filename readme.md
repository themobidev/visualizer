# Visualizer

This is a page builder application, inspired by tools such as Wix, Squarespace and WordPress.

Unfortunately, this project is outdated, and so it has been open-sourced to hopefully recruit help with modernizing. 


Built with AngularJS version < 2.0, and using PHP to faciliate an API for image upload, retrieving and a couple other services.

To run, make sure to have PHP installed. Latest versions of PHP come with a built-in runtime webserver. 

The original code is in /src.

After the repository is cloned and PHP is installed:

`cd /src`
`php -S localhost:9000`

Navigate to localhost:9000/_builder.html 

Feel free to change the port to whatever you'd like.
