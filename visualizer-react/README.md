# Visualizer-React
- This is a page builder application, inspired by tools such as Wix, Squarespace and WordPress. Unfortunately, this project is outdated, and so it has been open-sourced to hopefully recruit help with modernizing. We are trying to upgrade Visualizer using react.

- We are using React, Vite, Tailwind, React-dnd.
- After the repository is cloned use command `npm i` to install all npm packages
- To run the project use `npm run dev`
